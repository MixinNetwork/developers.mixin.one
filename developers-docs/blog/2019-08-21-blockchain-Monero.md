Mixin Network now supports the 22nd public chain Monero, the ticker is XMR, the official website is <https://www.getmonero.org/>.

Monero is the leading cryptocurrency focused on private and censorship-resistant transactions. Unlike Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, transactions in the Monero blockchain do not reveal where funds came from or went to, providing anonymity and making the currency completely fungible. Additionally, the amounts of all transactions are hidden by RingCT, a feature of Monero. For auditing or other transparency purposes a user can share a view key to prove they control certain amounts of Moneroj.
