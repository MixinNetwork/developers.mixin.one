Mixin Network now supports the 36th public chain Arweave, the token ticker is AR, the official website is <https://www.arweave.org/>.

Arweave makes information permanence sustainable.
Arweave is a new type of storage that backs data with sustainable and perpetual endowments, allowing users and developers to truly store data forever â€“ for the very first time.
As a collectively owned hard drive that never forgets, Arweave allows us to remember and preserve valuable information, apps, and history indefinitely. By preserving history, it prevents others from rewriting it.
