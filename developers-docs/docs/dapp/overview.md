## Messenger Bot

In addition to providing end-to-end encrypted chat and wallet functions, Mixin Messenger also supports bot functions similar to [Telegram bots](https://core.telegram.org/bots) and [WhatsApp Buz API](https://www.whatsapp.com/business/api).

Developers can easily implement powerful bots with functions such as transactions, paid content, and e-commerce. You can search for `7000101700` in Mixin Messenger to try a variety of selected bots.

By default, every Mixin application that be created at Developer Dashboard will be a Mixin Messenger bot.

### Features

- **Production-ready**:
  Given the authorization, the bots can obtain the user's basic information, asset list, transfer records, contact list, and other data. Developers can use the data to develop products and services.
- **Open**:
  You can put your bots online for your users without asking anyone's permission.
- **Fair**:
  There is no official bot market, independent developers or teams need to promote bots by themselves, and users who have a good experience will put your bots on the top of the homepage to give your bots first-level entrance!
