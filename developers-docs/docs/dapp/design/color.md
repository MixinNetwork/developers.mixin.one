# Colors

### Theme Color

When a user visits the bot's page, the built-in browser will try to extract the theme-color meta tag from HTML, and the status bar and title bar will automatically adapt the theme color:

```html
<meta name="theme-color" content="#673ab8">
```

### Button Colors


Button colors that are too bright or too dark will bring a poor user experience. The designer has choosen a set of button colors for developers, which performs well in both light and dark modes:
