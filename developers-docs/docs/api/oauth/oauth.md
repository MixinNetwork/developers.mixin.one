import Request from '../../_partials/request'

To access the profiles, assets, and other data of Mixin Messenger users, the developer needs to apply for authorization from the user.


## Requesting Authorization

```
GET https://www.mixin.one/oauth/authorize?client_id=CLIENT_ID&scope=PROFILE:READ+ASSETS:READ&response_type=code&return_to=
```

**Required Parameters**

- client_id - Bot ID.
- scope - Requested permissions
- response_type - Use "code" to return authorization code

**Optional Parameters**

- state - A random string generated by your application, which youâ€™ll verify later.
- code_challenge - The code challenge generated by your app, it's a SHA256 hash of your code verifier. For more information about it, please [visit here](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/pkce/authorization-request/)
- code_challenge_method - The code challenge method, please set it to `SHA256`


## Get Access Token

After successful authorization, the page will automatically jump to the bot's verification URL, the callback URL will be accompanied by the authorization code and return_to parameters, and the developer will then request a token based on the authorization code:

### POST /oauth/token

<Request title="Get access token" method="POST" isPublic url="/oauth/token --data PAYLOAD"/>

```json title="Payload"
{
    "client_id":        "unique bot identifier",
    "code":             "authorization code returned by the successful authorization callback",
    "client_secret":    "bot key"
}
```

```json title="Response"
{
    "access_token": "user authorization token",
    "scope":        "list of permissions that the user has given, e.g. 'PROFILE:READ ASSETS:READ'"
}
```

It is recommended that developers cache the access token and subsequently call the API to access the user data via the access token, to determine whether the user has authorized or not.

### Revoking Authorization

Developers can find the bot and revoke authorization in Mixin Messenger Settings, Privacy and Security, Authorization. Note that revoking authorization will also clear the cached information of the current bot on the client-side, such as cookies.
