## POST /session/secret

The upgrade from RSA to Ed25519 mainly involves PIN encryption and API access signature. After the Ed25519 key is generated locally, the successful call of the `POST /session/secret` interface means the migration is successful. Note that the process is irreversible and cannot be rolled back from Ed25519 to RSA.
