# Mixin Wallet

Based on Mixin Network, products such as decentralized wallets and decentralized on-chain exchanges can be quickly developed.

### Features

- **Security** Security is guaranteed by open source PoS decentralized network, TEE hardware, and full nodes supervised by tens of thousands of light nodes to prevent evil.
- **High Concurrency** One million TPS, suitability for large-scale commercial scenarios, and performance close to that of traditional centralized servers.
- **Free** Zero fee transactions, competency in micropayment and everyday payment scenarios.
- **Instant Transfer** It only takes 300 milliseconds to complete the verification and signature of a transaction without transaction rollback or double spending.
- **Versatility** Supports for 32 chains, including BTC, ETH, EOS, XMR, etc., and more than 100 thousand tokens.
- **Easy to use** 6-digit password for safe management of the wallet, easy to remember, and easy to use.
- **Multi-signature** Support for co-management of multi-signature assets among up to 255 people. Suitability for teams and families who want to co-own a large amount of an asset, and B2C or C2C platforms who want to co-manage the fund to prevent the platform from embezzling the fund.
- **Transaction Privacy** Except for the parties themselves, even full nodes do not know who are the parties in a transaction, there is no way to know the identities of the parties in a transaction from the transaction itself.
- **Developer Friendly** REST API makes it easy for developers to use any language they want to quickly implement products and services.
