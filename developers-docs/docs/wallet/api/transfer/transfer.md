### Precautions

- Once the transfer API is successfully called, it means that the data has been confirmed by all nodes, and the data is irreversible.
- One can't transfer money to himself.
- The encrypted PIN is one-time, and the PIN must be re-encrypted every time you transfer.
- It is strongly recommended that developers use `trace_id` to handle duplicate transfers, and always attach this parameter to transfers.
- All you need is to do it over again if you encounter 500 in a transfer.
- If you need to process a large number of concurrent transactions and process hundreds or thousands of transfers per second, it is recommended to use multiple accounts to transfer and send transactions.
- When a transfer error happens, pay attention to the "extra" field in the returned error message.
- If you see the error `20119` password is wrong when you are transferring, do not try again. It is recommended to call the [PIN Verification](../pin-verify) API to confirm.
