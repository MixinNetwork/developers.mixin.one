Mixin Network is a open network, it's open to the developers at both Kernel (aka, the Mainnet) and Mixin API levels.

According to the business needs and requirements, developers can choose the appropriate way to develop their dApps, chains, and any applications based on Mixin Network.

## Dive into the Kernel

If you want to build something with the kernel, or create a fork of Mixin Network with some modifications you like, you can read the [source code of Mixin Mainnet](https://github.com/MixinNetwork/mixin).

There are some tutorials that useful:

- [Deploying full node](mainnet/tutorials/full-node-join) - run mixin node in lcoal machine.
- [Sync full node](mainnet/tutorials/sync-full-node) - run mixin node in sync mode, sync all snapshots from the Kernel.

## Create Mixin Applications

Mixin Applications are applications that use the Mixin Network. It could be a website, an App, a messenger bot, or any other form of application that uses Mixin API or interacts with Kernel.

:::info
Mixin Application uses the Mixin API, a API set that provides the interface for the Mixin Mainnet, simplifys the development of Mixin. Please read [Mixin API Reference](api/guide) for more details.

### Messenger Bot

Most Mixin Applications have an interface called "Messenger bot"(shortened to "bot").

The bot is very similar to Telegram bot. Itâ€™s a program running on a server and interact with human being users with Mixin API.

Usually, people interacts with bots in a webview, or just chat with bots. Because of that, the bot should host a web service or respond to incoming messages to get its work done.

Here is [a tutorial](dapp/gettting-started/create-dapp) that shows you how to build a bot with the Mixin API:

###  Integrate with Mixin

Some Mixin Applications don't need the bot interface. They could be a website or a standalone mobile App.

A common scene is that your business runs well, but you want to make it cooler with cryptocurrency. So you need to integrate an existed system with Mixin.

The first thing you need to do is same as above, creating a bot. And then, it's time to think about the way to integrate with Mixin.

For example, if you have a CMS for multiple users, you want to put a donate button at the bottom of each post and receive money from audiences; you need to learn to create accounts for each author, manage accounts' keystores, sync and handle snapshots for each author in the CMS to transfer money to them.

Please read [this document](dapp/overview) guide for more details.
