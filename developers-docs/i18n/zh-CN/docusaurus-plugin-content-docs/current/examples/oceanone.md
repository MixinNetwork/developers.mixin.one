![TODO: English Version Img: OceanONE](./oceanone.png)

- **Name** OceanONE
- **Website** https://ocean.one/
- **Code** https://github.com/Mixinnetwork/ocean.one
- **Introduction** Ocean ONE is the next generation decentralized exchange based on Mixin Network, which is the first decentralized exchange that has the same experience as a centralized exchange.
- **Advantages** Feature-rich and performant.

The exchange features:

- Decentralization, user assets, and the matching engine are safely isolated, and assets are returned to the user's wallet immediately after the maker order is traded.
- On-chain transactions, all maker, taker orders, and order cancellations are recorded on-chain in each own transaction, which makes everything traceable.
- Security and transparency, the code is completely open-source and has passed the audit of third-party organizations.
- Excellent performance, the high-performance matching engine can meet the needs of quantitative trading, and 10,000,000 transactions can be completed within 24 hours.
- Currency richness, supporting the deposit, withdrawal, and trading of more than 100,000 tokens on 32 public chains.
- Uniqueness, all deposits and withdrawals between Mixin Network-based Dapps and exchanges are free and instant; token-listing is permission-less, and all are automatically supported by default; commission fees are fully refunded to the developers.

The separation of maker order assets and wallet assets greatly reduces risks while ensuring high performance. Keeping all trades on-chain ensures that all trades are real, and the open-source code ensures fairness in trades.
