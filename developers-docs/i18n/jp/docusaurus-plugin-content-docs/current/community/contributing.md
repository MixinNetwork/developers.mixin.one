Mixin and this documentation are open source. We are now welcoming contributors to collaborate on these.

## Preparation

Mixin developer documentation is based on [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/docs/en/latest/), a static site generator for React.js.

- You need to ensure that you have Yarn installed
- Clone the repository of the document
- Run `yarn` in the root of the `developer-docs`
- Run `yarn start` to preview the documentation

## Document Structure

The documentation is organized in the following way:

- all source is in the `docs` directory
- the `docs` directory contains the following subdirectories:
  - `api` contains all the API documentation
  - `dapp` contains all the DApp introduction, tutorials, guides
  - `mainnet` contains all the mainnet documentation
  - `community` contains all the community documentation
  - `examples` contains all the examples

The `sidebar.docs.js` file contains the sidebar of the documentation, which is separated into 2 sections: 'Docs' and 'API'.

## Contributing new content

### Writing new documentation

All content is written in Markdown format with react components extension.

The first step to contribute is to create a new markdown file at the right place in the `docs` directory.
For example, this document is in `docs/commnuity/contributing.mdx`.

If you are writing new content for specific topics, you can put them in the existed files:

- `Articles` - for articles, please update the [`articles.mdx`](./articles) file
- `Showcases` - for showcases, follow the 2 steps below:
  1. Add the information of showcase at `src/data/users.tsx` in alphabetical order.
  2. Put a screenshot at `src/data/showcase/`.

### Using components

There are some built-in components that can be used in the documentation in the directory `src/components/api`

- `<APIEndpoint>` is a component that renders an API endpoint
- `<APIMetaPanel>` is a component that renders an API's information including the authorizations and limitation
- `<APIParams>` is a component that renders an API's parameters
- `<APIPayload>` is a component that renders an API's payload
- `<APIRequest>` is a component that renders an API's request

Please refer to the [any document of 'API' section](/docs/api/guide) for the usage of them.

### Using partials

There are code snipples that can be used in the documentation in the directory `docs/partials`. Please consider using them.

### Adding to the sidebar

After you have created a new markdown file, you need to add it to the sidebar.

The sidebar file is `sidebar.docs.js` and it is located in the `docs` directory.

### Making a copy of the new file for translation

If you are adding a new documentation, you need to put a translation file at `i18n/$LANG_CODE` directory.

For example, this document is `docs/community/contributing.mdx` and its `zh-CN` translation is `i18n/zh-CN/docusaurus-plugin-content-docs/current/zh-CN/docs/community/contributing.mdx`.

## Translation

### Generate new translation files for new languages

If you're the maintainer of this project, please follow the instructions in the [i18n tutorial](https://docusaurus.io/docs/i18n/tutorial) to add a new language.

**Translate the index page**

Please follow the instructions [here](https://docusaurus.io/docs/i18n/tutorial#use-the-translation-apis) to translate your index page and react components.

**Generate/Update json files**

```bash
yarn run write-translations --locale $LANG_CODE
```

The `$LANG_CODE` is the language code of the language you want to generate. For example, if you want to generate the translation files for the French language, you should use `fr`.

The translation files are generated in the `i18n/$LANG_CODE/` directory.

**Generate Markdown files**

Copy the docs Markdown files to `i18n/$LANG_CODE/docusaurus-plugin-content-docs/current`, and translate them:

```bash
mkdir -p i18n/$LANG_CODE/docusaurus-plugin-content-docs/current
cp -r docs/** i18n/$LANG_CODE/docusaurus-plugin-content-docs/current
```

### Translate the documents

All the documents are placed in the `i18n/$LANG_CODE/` according to the languages.

- `i18n/$LANG_CODE/code.json`: the translation of the index page and the text used by docusaurus.
- `i18n/$LANG_CODE/docusaurus-theme-classic/footer.json`: the translation of footer.
- `i18n/$LANG_CODE/docusaurus-theme-classic/navbar.json`: the translation of navbar.
- `i18n/$LANG_CODE/docusaurus-plugin-content-docs/current.json`: the label of category on sidebar.
- `i18n/$LANG_CODE/docusaurus-plugin-content-docs/current/**`: the markdown files of documents.

**Preview the translation**

```bash
yarn run start --locale $LANG_CODE
```
