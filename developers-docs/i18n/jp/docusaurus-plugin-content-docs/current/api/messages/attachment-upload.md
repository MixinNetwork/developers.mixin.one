## POST /attachments

To upload an attachment, you must first create a new attachment.

<APIEndpoint url="/attachments" />

<APIMetaPanel scope="Authorized" />

<APIPayload>{`{
  // Just leave them empty.
  "attachment_id":  "",
  "upload_url":     "",
  "view_url":       "",
}
`}</APIPayload>

<APIRequest
  title="Update attachment meta info"
  method="POST"
  url="/attachments --data PAYLOAD"
/>

<RespAttachment />

### Upload the Attachment

You will get the `upload_url` from the previous response. Now upload the attachment to `upload_url`, and then the `attachment_id` can be used sending images, videos, files and other messages.

Mixin Messenger uploads the attachments using HTTP and store them on the Amazon S3, see [S3 documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sigv4-post-example.html) for more information.

Here is a [code snippet](https://github.com/fox-one/mixin-sdk-go/blob/master/attachment.go#L42) to upload an attachment.
