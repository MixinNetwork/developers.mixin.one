Both Mixin Core Team and community have developed SDKs for developers to use Mixin API.

### Overview

Mixin provides REST APIs. Developers are free to use any language familiar to develop Mixin wallets, such as Go, Java, Ruby, Node.js, PHP, C#, Javascript, Python, Swift, Koltin, etc.

- [Go SDK](./go)

- [Node.js SDK](./nodejs)

- [PHP SDK](./php)

- [Ruby SDK](./ruby)

- [Kotlin SDK](./kotlin)

The above SDKs are maintained by the Mixin team or third-party active developers. For other versions of the SDK, please refer to https://github.com/awesome-mixin-network/mixin_network_sdk_resource

- Go

  [bot-api-go-client](https://github.com/MixinNetwork/bot-api-go-client) is the SDK officially provided by Mixin. In addition to providing wallet-related API encapsulation, it also provides Mixin Messenger message related API encapsulation, see the code [blaze.go](https://github.com/MixinNetwork/bot-api-go-client/blob/master/blaze.go) for a specific implementation.

- PHP

  [mixin-sdk-php](https://github.com/ExinOne/mixin-sdk-php) is provided by the ExinOne team. If you encounter any problems, you can search for 26930 in Mixin Messenger for help.
