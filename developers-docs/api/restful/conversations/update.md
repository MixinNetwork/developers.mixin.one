### Muting

Muted conversations will still receive messages, but without notifications.

`POST /conversations/:id/mute`

Request body data:

| Parameter | Type | Description  |

| duration | Int64 | In seconds, setting to 0 means unmute, other values means mute time, for example, setting 28,800 means mute 8 hours |

If you mute users or bots, it is strongly recommended to pass the category and participants parameters, otherwise calling the mute interface without creating a conversation will return an error.
