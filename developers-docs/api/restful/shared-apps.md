# Sharing Bots

Both users and bots can be configured to share 3 bots on their personal pages, and they can also be displayed from the + menu in the lower left corner of the chat interface. This feature can greatly promote the spread of bots among users by word of mouth.

{
  "data": [
    $$XIN:app$$

}
```

```
$$XIN:curl$$ "https://api.mixin.one/apps/06aed1e3-bd77-4a59-991a-5bb5ae6fbb09/favorite"
