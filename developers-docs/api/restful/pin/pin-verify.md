## Error 20119 Debugging

- If you forget your PIN, there is no way to retrieve it. It is recommended to try 5 times a day and write down the tried code on paper.
- It might be due to the misuse of `iterator`, which should be incremental. Generally, it is recommended to use the current system Nano time, or you can set a number by yourself, and increment it with each call.
- The encrypted PIN is wrong, such as wrong format, wrong time, etc. It may be a problem of the SDK itself. It is recommended to contact the SDK developer for help.

Pay attention to the `extra` field in the returned error message. The error count will only increase if the PIN is incorrect, and the wrong `iterator` or wrong encrypted PIN will not cause the PIN to be locked.
