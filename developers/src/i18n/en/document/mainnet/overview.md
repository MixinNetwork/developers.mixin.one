### Overview
Mixin is a free, lightning-fast, peer-to-peer, cross-chain transactional network for digital assets, which enables other blockchain distributed ledgers to gain high TPS, sub-second confirmations, zero transaction fee, enhanced privacy, and limitless extensibility.

### Info
- __Launched__ October 2017
- __Token Supply__ 1 million 
- __Consensus Algorithm__ PoS + Asynchronous BFT
- __Block Confirmation__ Final confirmation in less than 1 second
- __Data Storage__ DAG
- __Number of Full Nodes__ 7 at least and 50 at most
- __Mining Rules__ 10% coins reserved for mining pools per year.
- __Security Enhancement__ Trusted execution environment(TEE)
- __Cross-Chain Technology__ Sidechain

### Features
__Multilevel Security__

Decentralized network based on punitive POS. Hardware-enhanced security with TEE. Supervision of tens of thousands of light nodes to prevent full nodes from doing evil.

__High Concurrency__ 

Competency in high-frequency real-world transaction use cases. Theoretical performance close to centralized servers. Millions or even higher TPS through hardware upgrade.

__Zero Fee Transactions__

Zero fee Transactions. Competency in micropayment and everyday payment contexts.

__Realtime Transactions__

The current 35 nodes can do verification and signing of a transaction in 300 ms.

__Versatility__

Supports for 37 chains, including BTC, ETH, EOS, XMR, etc., and more than 100 thousand tokens.

__Simpler Management__

Effortless multi-chain asset management with one single account, future public blockchains will also be supported by default.

__Multi-signature__

Support for co-management of multi-signature assets among up to 255 people. Suitability for teams and families who want to co-own a large amount of an asset, and B2C or C2C platforms who want to co-manage the fund to prevent the platform from embezzling the fund.

__Transaction Privacy__

Except for the parties themselves, even full nodes do not know who are the parties in a transaction, there is no way to know the identities of the parties in a transaction from the transaction itself.

__Regulation-Friendly__

The double-key structure ensures the anonymity of assets, users are free to share the view keys to accountants for taxation or audit purpose without losing the assets or their anonymity.

__Friendly Ecosystem__

No permission is necessary to connect to the network through REST APIs. Developers may use any language they are familiar with to achieve rapid product and service development.

__Stable Network__

Nodes charge a fee for each API call from DApps, so the income will not be affected by the fluctuation of XIN price, therefore sustainability and security can be guaranteed. The cost of development based on MIXIN network is predictable, pretty much like using AWS.
