- **Instant Transfer** It only takes 300 milliseconds to complete the verification and signature of a transaction without transaction rollback or double spending.
- **Versatility** Supports for 32 chains, including BTC, ETH, EOS, XMR, etc., and more than 100 thousand tokens.
- **Easy to use** 6-digit password for safe management of the wallet, easy to remember, and easy to use.
- **Multi-signature** Support for co-management of multi-signature assets among up to 255 people. Suitability for teams and families who want to co-own a large amount of an asset, and B2C or C2C platforms who want to co-manage the fund to prevent the platform from embezzling the fund.
- **Transaction Privacy** Except for the parties themselves, even full nodes do not know who are the parties in a transaction, there is no way to know the identities of the parties in a transaction from the transaction itself.
