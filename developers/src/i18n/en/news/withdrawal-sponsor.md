From now on, all Dapp developers are entitled to a full withdrawal fee subsidy. Specific rules are as follows: 
- All withdrawals are subsidized. The transactions between Dapps are actually going through internal transfers with no fees, so there is no need for subsidies. 
- Submit the withdrawal fee form to the Mixin team by the end of the month. After review, the subsidy will be paid before the 15th of the following month. 
- The withdrawal fee will be converted into XIN and returned to the developer. The conversion price of all fees will be subject to the price shown on CMC at 12:00 on the 1st of the next month.
